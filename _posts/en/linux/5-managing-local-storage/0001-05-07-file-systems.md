## Commonly Used File Systems

A filesystem is a method or structure that an operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved on a storage device, such as a hard drive, SSD, USB drive, or any other form of storage medium. It defines how files are named, stored, organized, and accessed by the operating system and the applications running on it.

### Key Functions of a Filesystem:

* Data Organization: Filesystems organize data into files and directories (folders). Each file has a name and a path that allows it to be easily located and accessed by users and applications.
* Storage Management: The filesystem manages the physical storage on the device, deciding how space is allocated, used, and freed up. It tracks which parts of the storage device are in use and which are free.
* File Naming: Filesystems provide rules for how files can be named, including restrictions on character sets, name length, and directory structure.
* Data Access: Filesystems define how data is read from and written to storage. This includes handling file permissions and ensuring that only authorized users and processes can access certain files.
* File Metadata: Each file has associated metadata, which includes information like its size, creation date, modification date, owner, and permissions. The filesystem manages and stores this metadata.
* Data Integrity: Some filesystems provide mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the data, such as journaling, checksums, and snapshots, which help protect data against corruption.
* File Permissions and Security: Filesystems often include features to enforce security policies, controlling who can read, write, or execute files.
* Data Recovery: Advanced filesystems may include features that aid in recovering data in case of hardware failure, accidental deletion, or corruption.

### Types of Filesystems: 


* Disk-based Filesystems: These are used on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and optical discs. Examples include NTFS (Windows), ext4 (Linux), and HFS+ (macOS).
* Network Filesystems: These allow files to be shared over a network. Examples include NFS (Network File System) and SMB/CIFS (Server Message Block/Common Internet File System).
* Memory-based Filesystems: These exist in volatile memory (RAM) and are used for temporary storage, such as tmpfs in Linux.
* Virtual Filesystems: These provide an interface to certain resources, such as /proc in Linux, which gives access to process and system information.


## Commonly Used File Systems

A filesystem is crucial for an operating system to manage and interact with data stored on various types of storage media, ensuring data can be efficiently and securely stored, accessed, and managed.

In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and Windows Server, the following filesystems are commonly used.

* Fulesystem Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL):

* ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem): The most commonly used filesystem in Linux, including RHEL. It is an improved version of ext3, offering better performance and larger volume and file sizes.

* XFS: A high-performance journaling filesystem, designed for scalability and high-throughput environments. XFS is often used in enterprise systems due to its reliability and performance with large files

* Btrfs (B-tree Filesystem): A modern copy-on-write (COW) filesystem that provides advanced features like snapshotting, subvolumes, and dynamic resizing. It is not as commonly used as ext4 or XFS in RHEL.

* tmpfs: A temporary filesystem stored in volatile memory (RAM). It is often used for files that need to be accessed quickly but do not need to persist after a reboot.

* vfat (Virtual File Allocation Table): A filesystem compatible with Windows' FAT filesystem. It's often used for compatibility between Linux and Windows systems, especially on removable media like USB drives.

* NFS (Network File System): Not a traditional disk-based filesystem, but a network filesystem that allows a system to share directories and files with others over a network.

* Windows Server:

* NTFS (New Technology File System): The default filesystem for Windows Server and most Windows operating systems. NTFS offers features like file permissions, encryption, disk quotas, and large file support.

* ReFS (Resilient File System): A newer filesystem introduced with Windows Server 2012, designed to maximize data availability and integrity. It is intended for use in high-availability and large storage environments.

* FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32): An older filesystem with wide compatibility. It’s often used on removable drives or in situations where backward compatibility with older systems is needed, though it has limitations like a maximum file size of 4 GB.

* exFAT (Extended File Allocation Table): An update to FAT32, designed to handle larger files and volumes. It’s commonly used on USB drives and other portable storage devices, especially when cross-compatibility between Windows and other operating systems is required.
